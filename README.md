I am Adel Sakkir. I am an Engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur (2022). I recently finished my Masters in Mathematics (Operations Research and Analytics) from the London School of Economics (2024). My primary interest lies in solving large scale combinatorial optimisation problems.
